A simple Minecraft server management tool

Ideas:
- Minecraft
- Teamspeak
- World of Warcraft (private server)
- Flashcards

Flashcards:
- Register and login
- Box
- Cards goes in a box
- CRUD for cards & boxes
- Run through a box and store the result

Minecraft:
- Do all the logic through the plugins, basically the web ui would just send commands to the plugins
- Use SOAP/REST API to interact with server
- Server must have the matching plugin installed
- Backup maps, restore backups
	- Download backup and upload through POST form
- Authentication would be required to use the API
- Add plugins from Bukkit official repo, remove plugins, edit configurations files...
- Update server jar archive
	- must work out technical details
	- have the plugin pull the latest craftbukkit/spiggot/whatever in the right folder on user demand
	- pop up to say that a new server version is available (only support one server provider for easiness sakes
- map of all users
- edit server properties
- edit users inventory
- run commands directly
- see console output (live ajax communication, websocket ? <3)
- user management/file management ?
- about menu
- configuration of the application
	- what notifications to receive
		- on player connect/disconnect, on mod connect/disconnect
	- on server shutdown

GUI:
- Regroup features in a side menu (that we could hide/show as necessary)

Serialize:
- search
- follow
- notifications
	- when episode comes out
	- weekly digest
	- mail, sms, push ?
- Rate and review episodes
	- redirect to IMDB or sthg ?
- share
